    "### What can we tell from personel income prediction with social economic conditions?  \n",
    "In assessment2, I would like to analyse a dataset from United States Census Bureau, the data was extracted from US government department website so I think it's safe enough and reliable. It is a data with 32561 samples and 15 features, by predicting the \"salary\" column(whether annual income is <=50K or >50K) I want to figure out what kind of features they have in common, is race, sex or education really matter to personel income, can we dig out part of the background story of a person by the data, the 15 features represent social economic conditions of each sample such as education, occupation, race etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the feature descriptions:  \n",
    "**0:age**  \n",
    "**1:workclass**(State-gov, Self-emp-not-inc, Private, Federal-gov, Local-gov, Self-emp-inc, Without-pay, Never-worked)  \n",
    "**2:fnlwgt(final weight)** = It is a synthetic feature controlled to independent estimates of the civilian noninstitutional population of the US. These are prepared monthly by Population Division at the Census Bureau. It use 3 sets of controls, which are:  \n",
    "    a. A single cell estimate of the population 16+ for each state.  \n",
    "    b. Controls for Hispanic Origin by age and sex.  \n",
    "    c. Controls by Race, age and sex.  \n",
    "    They use all three sets of controls in the weighting program and \"rake\" through them 6 times so that by the end it come back to all the controls we     used, People with similar demographic characteristics should have similar weights.  \n",
    "  **3:education**(Bachelors, HS-grad, 11th, Masters, 9th, Some-college, Assoc-acdm, Assoc-voc, 7th-8th, Doctorate, Prof-school, 5th-6th, 10th, 1st-4th,         Preschool, 12th)  \n",
    "  **4:education-num**  \n",
    "  **5:marital-status**(Never-married, Married-civ-spouse, Divorced, Married-spouse-absent, Separated, Married-AF-spouse, Widowed)  \n",
    "  **6:occupation**(Adm-clerical, Exec-managerial, Handlers-cleaners, Prof-specialty, Other-service, Sales, Craft-repair, Transport-moving, Farming, fishing, Machine-op-inspct, Tech-support, Protective-serv, Armed-Forces, Priv-house-serv)  \n",
    "  **7:relationship**(Not-in-family, Husband, Wife, Own-child, Unmarried, Other-relative)  \n",
    "  **8:race**(White, Black, Asian-Pac-Islander, Amer-Indian-Eskimo, Other)  \n",
    "  **9:sex**(Male, Female)  \n",
    "  **10:capital-gain**  \n",
    "  **11:capital-loss**  \n",
    "  **12:hours-per-week**  \n",
    "  **13:native-country**(United-States, Cuba, Jamaica, India, Mexico, South Korea, Puerto-Rico, Honduras, England, Canada, Germany, Iran, Philippines, Italy, Poland, Columbia, Cambodia, Thailand, Ecuador, Laos, Taiwan, Haiti, Portugal, Dominican-Republic, El-Salvador, France, Guatemala, China, Japan, Yugoslavia, Peru, Outlying-US(Guam-USVI-etc), Scotland, Trinadad&Tobago, Greece, Nicaragua, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Ireland, Hungary, Holand-Netherlands)  \n",
    "  **14:salary(<=50K, >50K)**\n",
    "  \n",
    "I believe this analysis can be highly relevant for such as social sciencies studies, humanitities studies, potencial charitable contributor recognition or other aspects that related to social inequality and human behavior. A very important point here, we only labeling people for computational analysis purpose, do not labeling people in normal life, each sample here are actually a humanbeing in real world.  "

Last one is working hours, we know that 40 hours per week is basic, here people who have higher income seem more hardworking, on the other hand we also have half the proportion of people who work less than 40 hours per week in <=50K group."

    "I would say definitely, it seems every feature here has something to do with income, to answer this question I have to combine some life experience with this analysis. We start with age feature, age distributed like that because human nature, people with older age means they have more time to make achievements in their life so they have a bigger chance to have higher income, people who are less than 20 years old are still learning in school, they don't get much time on earning income. Race is a very sensitive issue but I have to say, from this dataset it reflects racial inequality issue in America, according to US population data, 80% are white and 12% are black, in here we only see that only very few black people have income greater than 50K, the ratio is disproportional. Also in sex feature, when the income is greater than 50K, most of the people are male, it also reflects gender inequality issue in America.    \n",
    "  \n",
    "From interpersonal relations(marital-status and relationship), most of people in >50K group are married but male(gender inequality again), and most of people in <=50K group are single, some of them divorced, and some of them are single but own child, it reflects teenager issues in American society, people with less income have higher divorce rate, and a healthy interpersonal relations can be related to more income.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Let's also talk about education. In America the average university one year tuition is about 36K dollars, the bachelor's average annual salary is 64.5K, the high school graduated person's annual salary is about 41K dollars, which means the more education the person gets, the higher income the person gets. But the tuition is so expensive that some families can't afford it, education in America is a door that only people with a certain amount of wealth can walk in.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Also about jobs, big proportion of people in >50K group are manager or professional specialty, this also related to education I think, a good education gives you professional skills, makes you more competitive, also from working hours tells us that people with income greater than 50K are hardworking, some of them work over 40 hours per week, basically have 40 hours per week. About half of <=50K group work less than 40 hours per week, it could be the reason why they don't get much income, and we don't know the reason behind it by just looking at the numbers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally the investment, it is a reason to make income higher because successful investment can make additional income, but investment is like rolling a snowball, it can make the wealth gap bigger and raise the income inequality issue. "

    "I also made a decision tree model with optimal hyperparameters to do this classification prediction, the accuracy is about 0.85, which is quite good. This feature importance can tell us what the decision tree model thinks which feature is important to the result, it represents the whole dataset, while LIME tells us feature importance of each sample in the dataset. These two model's may have found the same pattern from the dataset but the prediction representations are different. From this feature importance it tells us that healthy marital status, age, education, capital investment and working hours are actually some really important features to the result of income less or greater than 50K, this conclusion basicly matches the result we got by neural network plus LIME."

    "I just realised that this dataset is actually from year of 1994 when finished analysis, I came up with black lives matter movement and Me too movement, we won't talk about how these movements purpose become bias, but since there are people who's still focusing on these issues, it means these social problem was never been solved these years. When I were counting these feature numbers with LIME's help, I also found some pattern such as young people who never married but own child with income less than 50K, young people with less than 40 working hours per week(I assume they are students), young adult and middle age white male who is married with high education number and income greater than 50K, people with income greater than 50K also have investment, people who is manager or professional specialty are more often with income greater than 50K etc. Just from these features I can already imagine a person's background.  \n",
    "If we want to go further for these social inequality issues, it can related to history, economic, politics and other aspects, so I just want to point out that wealth accumulates by generation after generation, most of the time good income makes good family background and leads to good education, good education also come back to good income, it is a virtuous cycle. In another hand, low income can be a reason for bad family background, and leads to bad education, education brings back low income issue, it becomes a vicious cycle. So the real issue is how to break the cycle of poverty, in the past days we also had external oppression reason such as apartheid and racism, nowadays people are still fighting against inequality, it is very frustrating when you know education may be a way of salvation but still struggling for next month's house rent, or as a female and knowing male has more chance to get higher occupation, or even get bullying just because you have different skin colour or culture background. To solve these issues we not only need our efforts, but also need the government to do something on administration, legislation and education."
